    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[The first thing I would advise the client about is creating a strong password, and adding two-factor authentication, such as OneLogin or Authenticator. If the password is strong and need two-factor authentication, it makes hacking the password more complicated, and nearly impossible. Afterwards I would advise to store as little sensitive information as possible, and try to hide most of it. For example credit card details or personal code, only display just enough so the owner can recognise. I would also configure the web server to use HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security because it encrypts the data sent between clients and server which makes it harder to find for the attacker. I would also advise them to keep track of the most common threats using OWASP list, and use vulnerability scanning tools. This is because the scanning tools looks for Cross-site scripting, SQL injection, Command Injection, Path Traversal and other server configurations made. It would be great for my client if they used continuous deployment, because it runs every change against some security checks, and then rejects and flags for rework if it doesn't pass the checks. ]</p>
